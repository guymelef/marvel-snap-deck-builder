# Marvel SNAP Deck Builder

This project was made entirely on the [Scrimba playground](https://mermaidjs.github.io/).

I was recently intrigued to learn Imba, the programming language. I set myself a challenge to learn it and use it to build the deck builder feature for the [browser extension](https://github.com/guymelef/snap-chrome-extension) I recently made.

This turned out to be quite a fun enjoyable learning experience with Imba.
